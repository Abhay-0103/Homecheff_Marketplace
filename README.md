# Homecheff\_Marketplace

**Homecheff\_Marketplace** is a React application bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js** (v14 or higher): [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js
  Verify installation:

  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhay-0103/Homecheff_Marketplace.git
   cd Homecheff_Marketplace
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will run the app in development mode.
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
   The page will reload automatically when changes are made.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

* `npm start` — Runs the app in development mode.
* `npm test` — Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
* `npm run build` — Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.
* `npm run eject` — Ejects the app, exposing configuration files (irreversible action).
